You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* Skills
I've learned that having a browser window open with a gif file is distracting! ;-)
I've also learned that it's not so easy to find the "right" semantic tags to use.

* It's been easy to do the basics.

* It's been difficult to go beyond the basics.

* Strategies
Yes, I have. Stackoverflow, baby!

Also, note to self: when your changes don't seem to take effect, make sure you are editing the element/elements
you "think" you are editing! (face palm)
